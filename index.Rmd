# **Johanna Learns R**

This website is operated for the purposes of Crim 250 Fall 2021 by Johanna Doherty, a senior in Criminology. I am interested in learning R in order to use statistical analysis for my upcoming senior thesis, and also think these skills will be applicable to me in my future career. This website will display my homework assignments, exam responses, and any other information relevant to Crim 250. Looking forward to a great semester learning R!
