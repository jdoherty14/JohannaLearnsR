<h3>Instructions for all assignments</h3>
<p>I want you to submit your assignment as a PDF, so I can keep a record of what the code looked like that day. I also want you to include your answers on your personal GitHub website. This will be good practice for editing your website and it will help you produce something you can keep after the class is over.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Download the Assignment1.Rmd file from Canvas. You can use this as a template for writing your answers. It’s the same as what you can see on my website in the Assignments tab. Once we’re done with this I’ll edit the text on the website to include the solutions.</p></li>
<li><p>On RStudio, open a new R script in RStudio (File &gt; New File &gt; R Script). This is where you can test out your R code. You’ll write your R commands and draw plots here.</p></li>
<li><p>Once you have finalized your code, copy and paste your results into this template (Assignment 1.Rmd). For example, if you produced a plot as the solution to one of the problems, you can copy and paste the R code in R markdown by using the <code>``{r} ```</code> command. Answer the questions in full sentences and Save.</p></li>
<li><p>Produce a PDF file with your answers. To do this, knit to PDF (use Knit button at the top of RStudio), locate the PDF file in your docs folder (it’s in the same folder as the Rproj), and submit that on on Canvas in Assignment 1.</p></li>
<li><p>Build Website, go to GitHub desktop, commit and push. Now your solutions should be on your website as well.</p></li>

<h1>Assignment 1</h1>
<p><strong>Collaborators: none. </strong></p>
<p>This assignment is due on Canvas on Monday 9/20 before class, at 10:15 am. Include the name of anyone with whom you collaborated at the top of the assignment.</p>

<h3>Problem 1</h3>
<p>Install the datasets package on the console below using <code>install.packages("datasets")</code>. Now load the library.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># install.packages(&quot;datasets&quot;)

<p>Load the USArrests dataset and rename it <code>dat</code>. Note that this dataset comes with R, in the package datasets, so there’s no need to load data from your computer. Why is it useful to rename the dataset?</p>

<pre class="r"><code>dat &lt;- USArrests</code></pre>
<p>Answer: It is useful to rename the data set because it makes it easier to remember the name we give it to use in code commands later on in the assignment. It helps to separate the base R package dataset and turn it into our own dataset to use with the following work.</p>
</div>
<div id="problem-2" class="section level3">
<h3>Problem 2</h3>
<p>Use this command to make the state names into a new variable called State.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>dat$state &lt;- tolower(rownames(USArrests))</code></pre>
<p>This dataset has the state names as row names, so we just want to make them into a new variable. We also make them all lower case, because that will help us draw a map later - the map function requires the states to be lower case.</p>
<p>List the variables contained in the dataset <code>USArrests</code>.</p>

<h3>Problem 3</h3>
<p>What type of variable (from the DVB chapter) is <code>Murder</code>?</p>
<p>Answer: Murder is a quantitative variable, because there are measured numerical values representing murder rates for each state.</p>
<p>What R Type of variable is it?</p>
<p>Answer: Murder is a character variable, as seen in the summary (dat) description in the code above.</p>
</div>
<div id="problem-4" class="section level3">
<h3>Problem 4</h3>
<p>What information is contained in this dataset, in general? What do the numbers mean?</p>
<p>Answer: This dataset contains the number of Murders, Assaults, and Rapes in each of the 50 states in the year 1973. It also shows us how many people lived in an urban area each state in that year, demonstrated by “UrbanPop.”</p>

<h3>Problem 6</h3>
<p>Please summarize <code>Murder</code> quantitatively. What are its mean and median? What is the difference between mean and median? What is a quartile, and why do you think R gives you the 1st Qu. and 3rd Qu.?</p>
<pre class="r"><code>#Summary of Murder

##   0.800   4.075   7.250   7.788  11.250  17.400</code></pre>
<p>Answer: The mean of Murder is 7.788, the median of Murder is 7.250. Mean represents the average number of murders between the 50 states in 1973, whereas mean is the middle number of murders if the quantities were lined up in numerical order. Quartiles are 4 approximately evenly sized groups with the data ordered from least to greatest. R most likely gives us Q1 and Q3 because the values between these two represent the middle 50% of the data, and provide more context for the spread of the mean.</p>

<h3>Problem 7</h3>
<p>Repeat the same steps you followed for <code>Murder</code>, for the variables <code>Assault</code> and <code>Rape</code>. Now plot all three histograms together. You can do this by using the command <code>par(mfrow=c(3,1))</code> and then plotting each of the three.</p>

<p><img src="Assignments_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-7-3.png" width="480" /></p>
<p>What does the command par do, in your own words (you can look this up by asking R <code>?par</code>)?</p>
<p>Answer: the command par is used to set certain parameters within the data given to it. In this case, we used the par function to tell R that we wanted to plot 3 character vectors on histograms together in one plot.</p>
<p>What can you learn from plotting the histograms together?</p>
<p>Answer: Plotting the 3 histograms together allows us to easily visually compare the frequency of murders, assaults, and rapes to see which crime was most common among the 50 states in the year 1973.</p>

<p>Read the data dat &lt;- read.csv(file = ‘dat.nsduh.small.1.csv’)</p>
<p>What are the dimensions of the dataset? names(dat) dim(dat)</p>
<p>Answer: The dimensions of the data are 7 variables/columns by 171 rows as seen above in the dimensions.</p>
</div>
<div id="problem-2-variables" class="section level2">
<h2>Problem 2: Variables</h2>
<p>Describe the variables in the dataset. Answer: These are all numeric variables in R, although not all are quantitative variables in the data set. For example, irsex is a qualitative variable, with two options male or female, but each sex has been coded to a corresponding number, either 1 or 2, to make it useful as a numeric variable in R.</p>
<p>What is this dataset about? Who collected the data, what kind of sample is it, and what was the purpose of generating the data? Answer: The dataset is about drug use and health in the United States. The NSDUH (National Survey of Drug Use and Health) collected the data from participants ages 12 years and older in 2019. This is an example of a state based sample survey. The purpose of collecting the data from this sample is to hopefully be able to generalize about the drug use habits and health of the wider US population.</p>
</div>
<div id="problem-3-age-and-gender" class="section level2">
<h2>Problem 3: Age and gender</h2>
<p>What is the age distribution of the sample like? Make sure you read the codebook to know what the variable values mean. hist(dat$age2) Answer: I used a histogram of the age2 variable (shown below) to demonstrate the distribution of age. Using the codebook to look at the meaning of the age2 variable, I can tell that the majority of respondents were between 35 and 49 years old (represented by the number 15 on this histogram). There was not a normal distribution of ages in this dataset, in fact the ages are skewed to the right, meaning there are more older participants than younger.</p>
<p>Do you think this age distribution representative of the US population? Why or why not? I do not think this is entirely representative of the distribution of ages in the US Population. While I do believe there are a lot of Americans falling into the 35-49 age group, I do not think there is such a drastically higher frequency of people of this age group than others. It is likely that this age group was just the most likely to fill out this kind of survey.</p>
<p>Is the sample balanced in terms of gender? If not, are there more females or males? hist(dat<span class="math inline">\(irsex) summary(dat\)</span>irsex)</p>
<p>Answer: (in this above histogram, 1 represents male and 2 represents female). The dataset is almost balanced in terms of gender, as can be seen in the histogram. However, there are slightly more males in the data set than females. This can also be seen when looking at summary data of the gender variable (screenshot above), the mean is 1.468, meaning there are slightly more males than females in this data set. If it were perfectly balanced the mean should be exactly 1.5.</p>
<p>Use this code to draw a stacked bar plot to view the relationship between sex and age. What can you conclude from this plot? tab.agesex &lt;- table(dat<span class="math inline">\(irsex, dat\)</span>age2) barplot(tab.agesex, main = “Stacked barchart”, xlab = “Age category”, ylab = “Frequency”, legend.text = rownames(tab.agesex), beside = FALSE) # Stacked bars (default)</p>
<p>Answer: From this plot we can conclude that while most age group are roughly evenly split between males and females, some categories are overwhelmingly one or the other. For example, age group 8 (19 years old) seems to be entirely female, while age groups 6 and 7 (17 and 18 years old) seem to be entirely male. Overall, there are roughly even amounts of males and females for each age group, but there are some outliers.</p>

<p>Answer: From these histograms, it appears that a higher frequency of respondents first tried marijuana between the ages of 10-15 than any other substance. For both alcohol and cigarettes, the tallest/highest frequency age blocks were older/further to the right than for marijuana.</p>
</div>
<div id="problem-5-sexual-attraction" class="section level2">
<h2>Problem 5: Sexual attraction</h2>
<p>What does the distribution of sexual attraction look like? Is this what you expected? table(dat$sexatract)</p>
<p>(For this variable; 1=heterosexual, 2=mostly attracted to opposite sex, 3=equally attracted to males and females, 4=mostly attracted to same sex, 5=only attracted to same sex, 6=not sure, 97=refused, 98=blank, 99=legitimate skip.)</p>
<p>Answer: It looks like the vast majority of respondents are heterosexual (only attracted to the opposite gender), which is pretty much expected given the demographics of the US population.</p>
<p>What is the distribution of sexual attraction by gender? tab.gendersexatract &lt;- table(dat<span class="math inline">\(sexatract, dat\)</span>irsex) barplot(tab.gendersexatract, main = “Stacked barchart”, xlab = “Gender Category”, ylab = “Frequency”, legend.text = rownames(tab.gendersexatract), beside = FALSE) # Stacked bars (default)</p>
<p>Answer: The distribution of sexual attraction by gender show that the sexual orientations of the females in this data set were more varied than those of the males. While the majority of both sexes still identified as straight, there were a higher frequency of women who identified as something other than straight as compared to the males.</p>
</div>
<div id="problem-6-english-speaking" class="section level2">
<h2>Problem 6: English speaking</h2>
<p>What does the distribution of English speaking look like in the sample? Is this what you might expect for a random sample of the US population? table(dat$speakengl)</p>
<p>Answer: The vast majority of respondents answered that they speak English very well, with only 21 selecting Well, and very few selecting anything less proficient than that. This does make sense to me, given that the national language of the US is English, but there are also a significant number of immigrants in the US that may not be as proficient in English. I would say that this is close to what I expected, but I may have expected to see more less proficient answers.</p>
<p>Are there more English speaker females or males? tab.sexspeakengl &lt;- table(dat<span class="math inline">\(speakengl, dat\)</span>irsex) barplot(tab.sexspeakengl, main = “Stacked barchart”, xlab = “Sex”, ylab = “Frequency”, legend.text = rownames(tab.sexspeakengl), beside = FALSE) # Stacked bars (default)</p>
<p>Answer: There are more English speaking males than females, but this is mainly because there are more males in the data set overall. There looks to be higher percentage of women that speak English “very well” compared to the men, but because there are a higher number of men overall, there are a higher number of men that speak English very well overall as well.</p>

<p><strong>The distribution of age is skewed to the right, with the center focused around 30 years of age.

<p><strong>There are way more male victims of fatal police shootings than females, as seen in the table above.

<p><strong>It is important to note that there is one unlabeled category in the fleeing variable, that represents 491 incidents. Given that we can not tell what this represents, we will omit it from the number and percentage of those who fled/did not flee. 2151 of the victims were fleeing at the time of the shooting.

<p>Problem 4 (10 points) - Answer only one of these (a or b).</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>Describe the relationship between the variables “body camera” and “flee” using a stacked barplot. What can you conclude from this relationship?</li>
</ol>
<p><em>Hint 1: The categories along the x-axis are the options for “flee”, each bar contains information about whether the police officer had a body camera (vertically), and the height along the y-axis shows the frequency of that category).</em></p>
<p><em>Hint 2: Also, if you are unsure about the syntax for barplot, run ?barplot in R and see some examples at the bottom of the documentation. This is usually a good way to look up the syntax of R code. You can also Google it.</em></p>

<p><strong>It is important to note again that there is one unlabeled category in the fleeing variable, that represents 491 incidents. Given that we can not tell what this represents, we will omit it from the analysis of the barchart. In the above stacked barchat, we can see that there seems to be a similar proportion of officers wearing body cameras for each category of fleeing/not fleeing. Although we can see that the Not fleeing category has a higher number of officers wearing body cameras, there are also a higher number of not fleeing incidents as compared to the other categories, so proportionally they look pretty similar across the board. From this distribution, it seems that there is no obvious relationship between body camera wearing and victim fleeing patterns, as there are very similar proportions of body cameras for each category of fleeing. It’s possible that a stacked barchart was not the best option to represent the relationship between these data, as we can not surmise much about the relationship from looking at this graph. </strong></p>

<pre class="r"><code>mydates &lt;- as.Date(dat$date)

<p><strong>This code shows us the dates when each of the recorded shootings took place, and by looking at the first few rows of data, we can see that there were 6 shootings in the first 4 days of 2015. The last line of code tells us the number of days between the first recorded shooting in the dataset and the most recent, which is 2458 days or 6.7 years. Given that the first dates are in January 2015 and we are now in October of 2021, this time difference makes sense.</strong></p>

<li>On Friday, a new report was published that was described as follows by The Guardian: “More than half of US police killings are mislabelled or not reported, study finds.” Without reading this article now (due to limited time), why do you think police killings might be mislabelled or underreported?</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>I think that police shootings could be mis-labelled or under-reported due to them being classified as less severe than they are. For example, if a victim is shot by the police, but does not die until they are in the hospital hours later, this might be classified as just a shooting and not necessarily a fatal shooting since the victim did not die on the scene. Although there should be no gray area, and any person who dies after being shot by the police should be recorded as a fatal police shooting, I can see the potential for mislabelling and underreporting with situations that occurr under murkier circumstances. .</strong></p>

<li>Regarding missing values in problem 4, do you see any? If so, do you think that’s all that’s missing from the data?</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>In the flee variable, there is an unlabeled category. Since we can not determine what these 491 incidents represent in terms of fleeing, we have to omit them from our analysis of the fleeing variable, which means we treat them as missing values. Given that this missing category exists, it would not surprise me to see that other variables have missing data as well. Given that “fleeing” could be seen as a matter of opinion or a subjective question in some challenging circumstances, it makes sense to me that there might be missing data in this variable. It seems possible that some of the other variables with “gray areas” or that are less clear cut could have missing data as well.</strong></p>

<p><strong>There is not an extremely defined relationship here, but it is slightly positively correlated with a correlation of .3228 as calculated above. A possible explanation for this relationship is that areas with people that have had more education may be more economically affluent and may be more likely to report crime that occurs. Since crime is more common in areas with lower socioeconomic statuses, people in these areas may be less likely to report given the commonality of these occurrences. So even if there are lower actual rates of crime in areas with higher education, there may be more reported crime.</strong></p>

<li>Is the relationship between reported crime and average education statistically significant? Report the estimated coefficient of the slope, the standard error, and the p-value. What does it mean for the relationship to be statistically significant?</li>

<p><strong>Given that the R-squared value of the linear regression is low (0.1042), the relationship between reported crime and average education is not statistically significant. The coefficient of the slope is 1.1161, and the p-value is 0.02668.

<li>How are reported crime and average education related? In other words, for every unit increase in average education, how does reported crime rate change (per million) per state?</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>The slope in our model tells us that for every 1 year increase in the average length of education in a given state, the # of crimes reported to the police per million population for that state will increase by 1.1161.

<li>Can you conclude that if individuals were to receive more education, then crime will be reported more often? Why or why not?</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>There are two issues with making this conclusion based on this data. Firstly linear regression provides a prediction based on a correlation and should not be used to make causal statements. If anything, one could say that more education is related to more reporting of crime, but no causal statements should be made. Secondly, it is difficult to assume either of these statements are accurate when some of the assumptions were not met. If all four assumptions for linear regression had been satisfied then we would have more confidence in the predictions made using this regression. Since this is not the case, it is possible that a linear model is not the right fit for this relationship, making it hard to make even correlational judgments based on this regression. </strong></p>
